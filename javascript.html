			<p>Here's stuff I found in my class notes from the Javascript class with Jason.</p>	
            <h3>Using document.getElementById() and .innerHTML</h3>
            <p>You use the document.getElementById to grab a specific element and do something with it. In the HTML you have an element that has an id like:</p>
            <p><xmp><p id="replace">this is some text</p></xmp></p>
            <p>NOTE: If you look at the source for the above paragraph, you'll see that I used an "xmp" tag to get the html elements to show up as litterals. But it placed the text way to the left... so I used the style for the p tag on the xmp tag and it worked.</p>
            <p>In a javascript file (.js), you use that id to identify the object you're going to do something with.</p>
            <h4>What the .js code looks like:</h4>
            <span class=code><p>var myQuote = '"What is a Week End?"';</p>
            <p>var myComment = "Who said this:";</p>
            <p>var message = myComment + " " + myQuote;</p>
            <p>var paragraphRef = document.getElementById("replace");</p>
            <p>paragraphRef.innerHTML = message;</p></span>	
            <h4>Here's the p called "replace"</h4>
            <p>In the .html file it's just like the one above (says "this is some text"), but once rendered it gets it's text (innerhtml) from the test.js file:</p>
            <p id="replace">this is some text</p>
            <h3>Modernizer</h3>
            <p>We learned about "Mondernizer". It's a JavaScript library that can tell if a client has all of the CSS3 and HTML5 features you're using. I *think* it let's you make if else statements for browsers that don't support the features you're using. We put the modernizer-latest.js file directly into the root folder for some reason and called it from the html file like this:</p>
            <xmp><script type="text/javascript" src="javascript/test.js"></script></xmp>
